Question 21

try:
    # Some code is here...
except:
    # Some code is here...
 

check_box_outline_blank
If there is a syntax error in code located in the try block, the except branch will not handle it, and a SyntaxError exception will be raised instead.

check_box_outline_blank
The code that follows the except statement will be executed if the code in the try clause runs into an error.

check_box_outline_blank
If you suspect that a snippet may raise an exception, you should place it in the try block.
